## üîç Abstract

Understanding soundscapes of the environment we live in enables us to perceive the changing
ecological niches with time. Soundscapes ecology attempts to visualize our environment to as-
sess patterns and interactions of biophony, anthrophony, and geophony. For this visualization
to happen, acoustic data from these three categories of sounds in a soundscape is analyzed and
processed. This process can be daunting and time consuming considering the ever-growing size of
acoustic data from ecologists. In this paper, I attempt to solve this analysis of acoustic data by
the use of Artificial Intelligence, particularly deep learning, to process, visualize, and classify sounds in any soundscape.
